# ABC-DA_1.5da_hybrid
ABC model with 3DVar and hybrid DA options (ABC-DA_1.5da_hybrid)

This repository can be considered a branch from the original ABC-DA_1.4da (https://github.com/rossbannister/ABC-DA_1.4da/) repository. The upgrades to the data assimilation system are added to a more recent version of ABC-DA (ABC-DA_1.5da) which was acquired through personal communication with RNB.

Hybrid ensemble-variational data assimilation options and ABC ensemble generation techniques have been added.
